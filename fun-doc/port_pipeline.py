"""
port_pipeline.py -- Stage 2/3 ("port" + "prove") of the OpenD2 conformance
pipeline described in OpenD2/docs/EMULATION_CONFORMANCE_PLAN.md Sec 14.

Stage 1 (document) is fun_doc's existing auto-doc worker. This module adds
the two stages that were, until now, entirely manual: drafting an OpenD2 C++
port and proving it against golden vectors minted from the original binary.

Scope (Phase 1, deliberately narrow): only PURE/LEAF functions provable via
the static `/emulate_function` oracle -- no live game process, no debugger,
no WOW64 dependency. Stateful functions (pointer/global-state args) are
classified and skipped, left to the existing manual `d2-port-function` /
`d2-conformance-harness` Claude Code skills in the OpenD2 repo. See the
CMake hazard note on GENERATED_CANDIDATES_DIR below before touching that
constant.

This module is standalone (like its sibling conformance_workbench.py) -- it
does not import fun_doc, so fun_doc/web.py import it, never the reverse.
Callers pass in whatever fun_doc state (conformance_protected set, funcs
dict) it needs rather than this module loading its own copies.

# classify_function -- pure/leaf heuristic (picks the oracle mode)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Signals that a decompiled function touches global state or deep pointer
# chains -- exactly what makes the static-emulation oracle unreliable (per
# EMULATION_CONFORMANCE_PLAN.md Sec 3, mode 1 vs mode 2/3). Conservative by
# design: classify_function must fail CLOSED (call it "stateful") on any
# ambiguity, since a false "leaf" would silently hand a stateful function to
# an oracle that can't prove it.
#
# IMPORTANT: a pointer parameter is NOT automatically disqualifying. The
# d2-port-function skill's own Step 3 classifies "reads args + maybe a seed
# pointer; no global state" as pure/leaf -- e.g. SEED_GetRandomNumberAlt
# takes `ulonglong *pSeed` (an in/out scalar blob the caller owns) and is
# PROVEN via static emulation (rng.json, 20/20). What actually disqualifies
# a function is a pointer to a *named struct/class type* (UnitAny*, Room*,
# StatList*) implying pre-existing game-world state that can't be
# constructed from scalar inputs -- that's the real "deep pointer chain"
# the plan means. Distinguish by base type: plain scalar/blob pointer types
# are fine; anything else is treated as a struct pointer -> stateful.
# Global access -> stateful (out of the STATIC emulation harness's scope: it
# can't populate a global's memory + the struct it points to). Two forms:
#   DAT_<hex>       -- Ghidra's auto-named data globals
#   _g_* / g_*      -- NAMED globals (e.g. _g_pDataTables, the data-tables root
#                      that every DATATBLS_* accessor dereferences). Found by
#                      hand 2026-07-07: the DAT_-only regex let these named
#                      globals through as "leaf", so the pipeline drafted them,
#                      minted (unusable) vectors, and only discovered the problem
#                      at STATIC-harness link time ("unresolved external symbol
#                      _g_pDataTables") -- three wasted LLM calls + builds per
#                      function. These are provable LIVE (the running game has
#                      the global populated), but that needs the runtime-resolver
#                      reimpl shape + a live-only path (see the note in
#                      classify_function); until then they are honestly stateful.
