"""abi_static.py -- MECHANICAL ABI derivation from disassembly (no model, no oracle).

Why this exists (2026-07-08 batch lessons, see D2MOO conformance workflow): the two
worst port failures were the drafting model GUESSING ABI facts that the disassembly
states outright:

  * GetAnimSequenceRecord: model declared __fastcall/ECX for a function whose disasm
    reads `[ESP+4]` and ends `RET 0x4` -- plain 1-slot __stdcall. Wrong callconv makes
    the ORIGINAL read its arg from the wrong place -> live_prove_failed, 3 retries.
  * DATATBLS_GetItemDataByCode: Ghidra's prototype said ONE param, but the disasm
    ends `RET 0xC` -- THREE stack slots (two unused). Marshalling 1 arg while the
    callee pops 3 corrupted the oracle stack -> SEH fault -> the function was wrongly
    written off as "blocked".

Both facts are 100% derivable statically:
  RET n            -> callee cleans n bytes  -> n/4 stack slots, stdcall-family
  [ESP+x] reads    -> which slots are actually used
  reads-before-writes of GP registers -> register-explicit incoming args
  `dword ptr [0x...]` absolute derefs -> data globals the reimpl needs resolved
  CALL <addr>      -> delegates (delegate-rung / not-a-leaf detection)
  decompile "Subroutine does not return" / _exit / CleanupAndAbort -> abort class
    (out-of-range input KILLS the process/bridge -> vectors must stay in-envelope)

derive_abi() is heuristic-but-honest: linear scan with an ESP-delta tracker; any
construct it can't track precisely (calls, branches before stack reads) sets
`approx=True` so callers treat used_slots as advisory while ret_imm/slots stay
authoritative (RET n is unambiguous).

Standalone: stdlib only. Self-test: python abi_static.py  (runs the 4-function
known-answer corpus captured from live D2Common 1.13c).

    `CMP v,imm; Jcc` value-substitute (`return (v==imm) ? fallback : v`).
